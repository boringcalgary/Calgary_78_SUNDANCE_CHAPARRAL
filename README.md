We will be using SUMO simulator:

Project steps:
1.
We will recreate the Calgary_78_SUNDANCE_CHAPARRAL bus route
2.
Replace bus route with new Boring Compnay vwvilces and tunnels
3.
Compare A/B
4.
A
Total transit time for all riders
Avarge trasnit times for all riders
B
Total transit time for all riders
Avarge trasnit times for all riders
5.
Next we will add
Total operational cost
Total rider revenue

6-10
We will repeat the 1-5 steps for the new GreenlineLRT:
